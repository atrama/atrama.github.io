    <h1><a href="/2016/11/15/the-new-site/">The new site</a></h1>
    <span class="post-meta">Nov 15, 2016</span>
      <p>The new site is finally done! It’s actually been done for a few months now, but my 11 week old son has sort of thrown a wrench into side projects. If you’re not familiar with Jekyll, it’s a static site generator. Meaning, instead of having a bunch of layouts and config files that run server-side when the user visits your page (which takes time), you compile everything in your dev environment, then ship it to production. So yes, you have a bunch of HTML files, but you only manage a handful of layouts and Jekyll does the job of compiling all those HTML files before you deploy. And all the server has to do, is spit out plain HTML. No server-side processing required. There were a number of reasons I moved from WordPress to Jekyll, namely:</p>

    <h1><a href="/2016/05/16/onward-to-jekyll/">On to Jekyll!</a></h1>
    <span class="post-meta">May 16, 2016</span>
      <p>Today I’m switching my site over to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I’ve done a couple small Jekyll projects, but never a full blog and portfolio. And it will have updated projects, since this site hasn’t been updated in years. Plus, I’m hoping to incorporate some posts about my house’s remodel to show where my time has gone the last 2 years. Updates to come…</p>

    <span class="post-meta">May 16, 2016</span>
      <p>When I started one of my jobs, I had to attend an orientation that featured a panel of rising stars at the company who were there to give advice on how to succeed at the company. Every panelist offered “work hard” as their advice to success. If they needed to tell me to work hard to succeed at my new job, they had already failed at their hiring choice. “Work hard” is the upfront advice equivalent to “try harder” after somebody makes an honest mistake.</p>

    <span class="post-meta">Jun 28, 2015</span>
      <p>My <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> build recently slowed down dramatically. Like minutes to build versus a few seconds before. Since Jekyll relies on ruby to watch for changes, then compile all your files into a new _site folder, this made working virtually impossible.</p>

    <span class="post-meta">Mar 3, 2014</span>
      <p>Let me start by saying, I like the flat design trend. And yes, I do believe that it is a trend. Overall, I really liked iOS7 when it came out; and I still like it. There are some apps that I believe have a worse user experience now, such as calendar and contacts (why does the never-used notes section take up so much space above “send message” and “share contact”), but overall I like the design.</p>

    <span class="post-meta">Nov 24, 2013</span>
      <p>While trying to figure out how to win my <a title="Yahoo Fantasy Football" href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com" target="_blank">fantasy football</a> matchup with my ragtag group of second stringers, I noticed the page I was on seemed to have some sort of bug. So, like any sports fan, my first instinct was to open Chrome’s Dev Tools and see if I could spot the JavaScript error. Yeah, there were a few, but what I really noticed was Yahoo’s free, easy, effortless recruiting tactic. The following message appeared right at the top of their console log</p>
