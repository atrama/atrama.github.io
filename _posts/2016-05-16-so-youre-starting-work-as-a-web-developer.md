When I started one of my jobs, I had to attend an orientation that featured a panel of rising stars at the company who were there to give advice on how to succeed at the company. Every panelist offered &#8220;work hard&#8221; as their advice to success. If they needed to tell me to work hard to succeed at my new job, they had already failed at their hiring choice. &#8220;Work hard&#8221; is the upfront advice equivalent to &#8220;try harder&#8221; after somebody makes an honest mistake. 

My first job out of college started a little different. I was given a piece of advice day one and I still remember it to this day. One of the directors called me into their office. Now, keep in mind that two months before this day, I was living in a fraternity house with 12 other guys. Now I was working in an office not much larger, but with almost all women, many of whom were old enough to be my mom. I was raised to respect your elders and say yes. My new colleague, was quick to point out &#8220;listen, I and many of the other people here are old enough to be your parents and it&#8217;s good to have respect, but don&#8217;t ever feel like you can&#8217;t say no. You have a job to do and you need to be fair and responsible to that role.&#8221; It was hard to do, but there&#8217;s no question that it made me a better employee. &#8220;Work hard,&#8221; &#8220;be nice,&#8221; and &#8220;show up early&#8221; are all great pieces of advice, but I&#8217;m a fan of more off-beat advice. It has helped me in my career, so here&#8217;s my advice to people starting out in web development; which can really be used in any field.

## Somebody brought donuts, grab one. Then bring them in next time

Seriously, go for it. But don&#8217;t take 2 until later in the day when everyone has had a chance to get some. You might be a starving, not so far removed from being a college student employee or intern, and your colleagues probably know that, but show them that first and foremost you&#8217;re a professional. Next week, bring in donuts, make brownies, buy some bags of chips, do something to show you&#8217;re a part of the team. Especially if you&#8217;re an intern. Do you know how often interns bring things in? Not very often. Do you know how much they stand out when they do it? A lot. You&#8217;re likely auditioning for a job, why not do something small to stand out?

## Volunteer to be challenged

On a scale of 1-10, you&#8217;re a 4 as a developer. Volunteer the next time a project is 5 in terms of difficulty. Don&#8217;t volunteer for the 9, that&#8217;s just stupid. Baby steps. 

Also, freelance on the side or create a side project. You are hopefully learning a lot on the job, but learn something (a framework, tool, etc.) outside of your team&#8217;s stack and you just might be able to be the person who already has a head start if the team has an opportunity for it. 

## Pretend you care about the boring adults

You know how I know my tales of home improvement and 90&#8217;s era TV references are boring? Because not long ago, I listed to people a decade or two older than me talk about their life and thought some of it sounded boring. But you&#8217;ll make a connection with them and learn some life lessons outside of work. You might just wind up being friends!

## You&#8217;re failing. Tell your boss

You know what sucks more than telling your boss you might have bit off more than you can chew before a deadline? Telling your boss after a deadline. 

A good boss will challenge you; and a good employee will challenge themselves. But a good boss will never leave you out to fail. They might ask you if you can write a new project using a framework or concepts you&#8217;re not familiar. Don&#8217;t say no, accept the challenge and be honest up front. But if you&#8217;re not hitting the marks you both expected at a certain point into the project, ask for help. Maybe there&#8217;s a senior developer who can mentor you. A good boss will respect your hard work and honesty, because in the end, you&#8217;re going to become a better person to work with after learning those new concepts, rather than committing bad code or work-arounds.
