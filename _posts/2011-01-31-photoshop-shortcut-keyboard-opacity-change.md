## To change the opacity of a&#8230;

  1. **Brush:** Select the brush tool (keyboard shortcut: _B_), then type your number
  2. **Eraser:** Select the eraser tool (keyboard shortcut: _E_), then type your number
  3. **Layer or Folder:** Make sure you don&#8217;t have a brush or eraser selected (I usually hit &#8220;V&#8221; on the keyboard to select the move tool), then type your number.

## Change the opacity to&#8230;

  1. **10:** Hit _1_ on the keyboard. Same goes for 20 _(2),_ 30 _(3),_ etc.
  2. **31:** Hit _31_ (quickly) on the keyboard. Same goes for 42 _(42),_ 74 _(74),_ 9 _(09),_ etc.
  3. **100:** Hit __ on the keyboard.
  4. **0:** Why would you do that? Just hide or delete your layer!
