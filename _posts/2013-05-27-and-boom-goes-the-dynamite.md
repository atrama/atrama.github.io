When I decided to finally update my site and blog, after close to 5 years without a redesign and 2 years without a new post, I initially thought about blowing up the whole thing and starting over. Most people change, for better or worse, over time. Their ascent or descent is gradual. Pedro Martinez didn&#8217;t go from a 1.74 ERA and joking about the Yankees being his Daddy to sporting a Phillies uniform while making the NL East his daddy overnight.

Continuing with the world&#8217;s worst metaphor, when a blog goes 2 years without an update, comparing posts is (hopefully) like comparing apples to old, rotten apples. Not that I&#8217;m trying to claim I&#8217;m a Pedro Martinez caliber web developer. I have better taste in <a title="Pedro Martinez" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PedroMartinezSmall.jpg" target="_blank">hair</a>.

Since my previous post, I have

  * Learned a few new skills and drastically improved my knowledge of a few languages
  * Started a new job
  * Received a promotion
  * Tied the knot
  * Improved my health
  * Most importantly, won my first fantasy baseball championship

Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve decided to keep the old blog posts. After all, there aren&#8217;t very many and I would hate to disappoint all the active commenters. Take for instance the guy who knows where I can get a great deal on R0lex watches, the non-bot with perfect English who has SEO secrets that he&#8217;s unlocked, or my future bride who is currently living in Russia and just waiting for me to bring her over the &#8220;United State of America.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s good to look at failures and embarrassments. They keep you moving forward; and at the very least, it will motivate me to write more so I can bury those old posts.

So here&#8217;s to writing better, more insightful content more often. Or at least bouncing back a little.
