While trying to figure out how to win my <a title="Yahoo Fantasy Football" href="http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com" target="_blank">fantasy football</a> matchup with my ragtag group of second stringers, I noticed the page I was on seemed to have some sort of bug. So, like any sports fan, my first instinct was to open Chrome&#8217;s Dev Tools and see if I could spot the JavaScript error. Yeah, there were a few, but what I really noticed was Yahoo&#8217;s free, easy, effortless recruiting tactic. The following message appeared right at the top of their console log

> Like poking around in code? Like fantasy sports? Yahoo! Fantasy Sports is currently hiring both front and back end engineers. If you&#8217;d like to get paid to do what you love, drop us a resume at sportsjobs@yahoo-inc.com, and let us know where you found the e-mail address!

Seems like an easy, no-brainer way to find niche developers (remember, Yahoo asks you to mention where you found the email address). I don&#8217;t think other industries such as banking, communication, healthcare, etc. would benefit in the same way Yahoo may from this, but if you&#8217;re looking for developers who use your product, why not give this, or something similar (i.e., adding a similar comment in your source), a try?
